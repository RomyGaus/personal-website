# Personal Website

This is my personal website which I developed following the completion of "The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery" course. 

Here are some of the highlights of my learnings from this project:
- Furthered my comfortability with React JS
- Deepened my knowledge of CSS animations
- Implemented a reverse scrolling mechanism
